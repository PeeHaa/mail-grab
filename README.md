# MailGrab

Catch-all SMTP server for local debugging purposes.

This SMTP server catches all e-mail being sent through it and provides an interface to inspect the e-mails.

*Note: this SMTP server is meant to be run locally. As such several security considerations (e.g. SMTP transaction delays) has been omitted by design. Never run this project as a public service.*

## Project status

Currently just a PoC. All things will change.
